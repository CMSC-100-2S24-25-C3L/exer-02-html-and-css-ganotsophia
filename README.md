To start creating the page, I recalled and reviewed basic HTML syntax and searched some resources as a guide. I started by adding div containers to organize text and sections then added contents along with the aesthetics. HTML helps in the structure and layout of the website while CSS focuses on the design and styling of the website. Navigating div classes and flexbox helped me to organize the contents and make it more pleasing to the user.
